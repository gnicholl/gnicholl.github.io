title: "ksmirnovk: Stata Program for Performing a k-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test"
type: post

<a href="https://github.com/gnicholl/ksmirnovk">Here is some Stata code</a>
I wrote back in 2017. A colleague asked how to perform a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in Stata when there are more than two groups.
I was surprised to find that such a test is not implemented
in Stata, nor widely implemented in general.
I thought perhaps that this was because such a test did not exist. 

On the contrary, a k-sample analogue to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
was developed back in 
<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-30/issue-2/K-Sample-Analogues-of-the-Kolmogorov-Smirnov-and-Cramer-V/10.1214/aoms/1177706261.full">
1959 by Jack Kiefer</a>, a 
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2683084?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">mathematical statistician at Cornell</a>. 
I thought it would be straightforward to implement the test given Kiefer's
formula--all we need is a test statistic and and a CDF. As you will see,
it took me down a road of infinite sums, quadrature, and bessel functions.

The test statisic is straightforward conceptually, though cumbersome to program, as it relies
on computing maximum (squared) differences between empirical CDFs.
Let's say we are interested in testing the null hypothesis that the distribution of \\(X\\) 
differs in at least one of \\(k\\) groups. Analogous to the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
we use the following test statistic:

$$D = \sqrt{\max_x \sum_j n_j (S_{n_j}^{(j)} (x) - \bar {S_N} (x))^2}$$

Where \\(j = 1,...,k\\), \\(n_j\\) is the number of observations in group \\(j\\), 
\\(S_{n_j}^{(j)} (x)\\) is the empirical CDF of group \\(j\\),
and \\(\bar {S_N} (x)\\) is the empirical CDF of the pooled data (i.e. \\(N = \sum_j n_j\\)).

Kiefer's contribution was to provide an asymptotic CDF for the distribution of this test statistic
for general  \\(k \geq 2\\),
thereby giving us a method for testing our null hypothesis. The CDF is as follows:

$$\Phi_k(d) = Pr(D < d; k) = \frac{4}{\Gamma(\frac{k-1}{2})(2d)^{(k-1)/2}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\gamma_{\frac{k-3}{2},n} \exp \{\frac{\gamma_{(k-3)/2,n}}{2d}\}}{\[J_{\frac{k-1}{2}} (\gamma_{(k-3)/2,n})\]^2}$$

and the p-value for our test is \\(Pr(D > d; k) = 1 - \Phi_k(d)\\).

In the case of \\(k=2\\), this test simplifies to

$$\Phi_2(d) = \sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{d}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} e^{-\frac{((2n-1)\pi)^2}{8d} }$$

which is the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v008i18">
original two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</a>.

It turns out the formula also simplifies to elementary functions
in the case of \\(k=4\\):

$$\Phi_4(d) = \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi^5}{d^3}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  n^2 e^{-\frac{(n\pi)^2}{2d}}  $$

However, in the cases \\(k=3\\) or \\(k>4\\) it is a slow and computationally intensive task to compute the CDF.
This is because it depends on \\(J_{(k-1)/2}\\), which is a bessel function of the first kind,
and \\(\gamma_{(k-3)/2,n}\\), which is the nth root of bessel function \\(J_{(k-3)/2}\\). 

Bessel funtions have infinitely many roots, and we need to find as many as we can
in order to approximate the infinite sum in \\(\Phi_k(d)\\). 
Additionally, the bessel function itself can be written using integrals,
and therefore requires quadrature to compute.

To speed things up for real-time use,
I pre-compute the first 30 Bessel roots in cases \\(k=3,5,6,7,8,9,10\\).
Therefore, as long as you are not attempting this test on 11 or more groups,
it should run relatively quickly, though we still need to evaluate the bessel
function using quadrature (unless \\(k=2\\) or \\(k=4\\)), and to compute
the first 30 terms of the infinite sum. 

It turns out that 30 roots (i.e. 30 terms of the sum)
and 200 quadrature points was enough to 
<a href="https://github.com/gnicholl/ksmirnovk/raw/main/LookupTable.xlsx">
reproduce Kiefer's results</a>,
which were reported up to 6 decimal places for cases \\(k=2,...,6\\).
I imagine that with more experimentation, one could find that even fewer roots
and fewer quadrature points would be sufficient. Note for example that in 
<a href="https://www.stata.com/manuals/rksmirnov.pdf">Stata's documentation of
the ksmirnov command</a> they use only the first 5 terms, though this is
of course only in the simpler \\(k=2\\) case.

The command can be run simply as 

```
ksmirnovk X , by(group)
```

where `group` should contain categories that are integers from \\(1\\) to \\(k\\).

I think Kiefer would be pleased that someone implemented his test all these years later and double-checked his results!
