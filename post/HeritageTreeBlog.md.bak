Due to COVID, my wife and I have started enjoying nature a lot more. It turns out Ontario
is a beautiful place with lots to see, including some really cool old trees!
Forests Ontario has been cataloguing such trees in Ontario, and so we've
been using their 
<a href="https://fontario.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=b83bbc938d8b48c2ad311d451e2a8fd8">map</a>
to find them. Forests Ontario thought it was cool, and so asked me to write an article about 
our tree exploits! It was a really fun and nerdy experience and you can find the article
