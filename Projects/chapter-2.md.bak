title: "ksmirnovk: Stata Program for Performing a k-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test "
---

<a href="https://github.com/gnicholl/ksmirnovk">Here is some Stata code</a>
I produced back in 2017. A colleague asked how to perform a k-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in Stata, and I was surprised to find that it is not widely implemented.
I was more surpised to discover that such a test was developed back in 
<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-30/issue-2/K-Sample-Analogues-of-the-Kolmogorov-Smirnov-and-Cramer-V/10.1214/aoms/1177706261.full">
1959 by J Kiefer</a>. I thought it would be straightforward to implement the test given Kiefer's
formula--all we need is a test statistic and and a CDF.

The test statisic is straightforward conceptually, though a bit cumbersome to program.
Let's say we are interested in testing the null hypothesis that the distribution of \\(X\\) 
differs in at least one of \\(k\\) groups. Analogous to the 2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
we use the following test statistic:

$$D = \sqrt{\max_x \sum_j n_j (S_{n_j}^{(j)} - \bar {S_N} (x))^2}$$

Where \\(j = 1,...,k\\), \\(n_j\\) is the number of observations in group \\(j\\), 
\\(S_{n_j}^{(j)}\\) is the empirical CDF of group \\(j\\), and \\(\bar {S_N} (x)\\)
is the empirical CDF of the pooled data (i.e. \\(N = \sum_j n_j\\)).

Kiefer's contribution was to provide an asymptotic CDF for the distribution of this test statistic,
thereby giving us a method for testing our null hypothesis. The CDF is as follows:

$$\Phi_k(d) = Pr(D < d; k) = \frac{4}{\Gamma(\frac{k-1}{2})(2d)^{(k-1)/2}} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\gamma_{\frac{k-3}{2},n} \exp \{\frac{\gamma_{(k-3)/2,n}}{2d}\}}{\[J_{\frac{k-1}{2}} (\gamma_{(k-3)/2,n})\]^2}$$

and the p-value for our test is simply \\(1 - \Phi_k(d)\\).

For \\(k=2\\) and \\(k=4\\), this CDF reduces to a nice closed-form.
For \\(k=3\\) or \\(k>4\\) it is a slow and computationally intensive task.
\\(J_v\\) is a bessel function of the first kind, and \\(\gamma_{v,n}\\) is the nth root
of \\(J_v\\). You will note that we need to find as many roots as we can
in order to approximate the infinite sum in \\(\Phi_k(d)\\). 
Additionally, the bessel function itself can be written using integrals,
and therefore requires quadrature to compute.

To speed things up, I pre-compute the first 30 roots for \\(k=3,5,6,7,8,9,10\\)
in my program,
so that this does not need to be done on the fly (though we still need to evaluate
the bessel function using quadrature). This was enough to reproduce Kiefer's results,
which were reported up to 6 decimal places.

The command can be run simply as 

```
ksmirnovk X , by(group)
```

where `group` should contain categories that are integers from \\(1\\) to \\(k\\).

I think Kiefer would be please that someone implemented his test all these years later and double-checked his results!
