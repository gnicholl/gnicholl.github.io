<p style="text-align:left;"> I love music and play guitar and drums. One day this page may contain
my recordings, but in the meantime here is a Spotify playlist of recomendations including finger-style
folk/blues guitar, bluegrass, country, indie, psych rock, progressive metal, and more.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"> My favourite band is King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard for their varied and eclectic music: </p>

<p style="text-align:left;"> If you happen to be a Gizz fan, 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w9mp9ikhetpzseo/AAAHgXo9N5-cbrN8Vp1Txztpa?dl=0">here</a> 
is my dropbox folder of live bootlegs I've dug up from
all over the web. Thanks to the many Gizz fans who have recorded these! Gizz taping is not
quite at the level of the Grateful Dead, but the scene is growing.</p> 
  
<p style="text-align:left;"> Here are a couple pictures of me making a fool of myself in front of Cavs and
Stu from King Gizz after their 2019 show in Montreal: </p>

<p style="text-align:left;"> Stu stuck his tongue out in all the fan pictures, except mine.
The memory keeps me up at night.</p>
