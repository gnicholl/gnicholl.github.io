      <description>I gave this presentation on December 6, 2021 as part of the course SURV727 &amp;ldquo;Fundamentals of Cmputing and Data Display.&amp;rdquo; I use R for data collection, and then clean and analyze the data in Stata.
My data science experience grew quickly and greatly during this course, and I had a lot of fun combing various sources of data involving API&amp;rsquo;s from Spotify, Last.FM, Wikipedia, and Google, and using web scraping techniques to obtain review scores from Wikipedia.</description>

      <title>ksmirnovk: Stata Program for Performing a k-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test</title>

      <description>Here is some Stata code I wrote back in 2017. A colleague asked how to perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in Stata when there are more than two groups. I was surprised to find that such a test is not implemented in Stata, nor widely implemented in general. I thought perhaps that this was because such a test did not exist.
On the contrary, a k-sample analogue to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was developed back in 1959 by Jack Kiefer, a mathematical statistician at Cornell.</description>
