      <description>I gave this presentation on December 6, 2021 as part of the course SURV727 &amp;ldquo;Fundamentals of Cmputing and Data Display.&amp;rdquo; I use R for data collection, and then clean and analyze the data in Stata.
My data science experience grew quickly and greatly during this course, and I had a lot of fun combing various sources of data involving API&amp;rsquo;s from Spotify, Last.FM, Wikipedia, and Google, and using web scraping techniques to obtain review scores from Wikipedia.</description>

I was more surpised to discover that such a test was developed back in 1959 by J Kiefer. I thought it would be straightforward to implement the test given Kiefer&amp;rsquo;s formula&amp;ndash;all we need is a test statistic and and a CDF.</description>
