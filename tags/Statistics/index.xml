      <description>Here is some Stata code I wrote back in 2017. A colleague asked how to perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in Stata when there are more than two groups. I was surprised to find that such a test is not implemented in Stata, nor widely implemented in general. I thought perhaps that this was because such a test did not exist.
On the contrary, a k-sample analogue to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was developed back in 1959 by Jack Kiefer, a mathematical statistician at Cornell.</description>

      <description>Meng (2018) summarizes the Big Data Paradox as &#34;The more the data, the surer we fool ourselves.&#34;It may be counterintuitive at first--even a trained Statistician is likelyto get caught in the idea that &#34;more data is better&#34; at some point.But this idea can be quickly squashed with simple examples. For instance,if we are interested in measuring the average height of the population,surveying 1,000 men is going to give us an estimate that is too high.</description>
