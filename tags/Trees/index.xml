      <description>Due to COVID, my wife and I have started enjoying nature a lot more. It turns out Ontario is a beautiful place with lots to see, including some really cool old trees! Forests Ontario has been cataloguing such trees in Ontario, and so we&amp;rsquo;ve been using their map to find them. Forests Ontario thought it was cool, and so asked me to write an article about our tree exploits! It was a really fun and nerdy experience and you can find the article here.</description>
