      <description>I wrote an R package for conducting Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) as part of my first-year comps. Find it here. It is based largely on Koehn&amp;rsquo;s 2009 SMT book and implements the so-called &amp;ldquo;IBM&amp;rdquo; models, as well as phrase-based translation. While these methods have been largely supplanted by neural network-based methods, they are still interesting models, and the IBM models can be used to derive word alignments between a sentence and its translation.</description>
