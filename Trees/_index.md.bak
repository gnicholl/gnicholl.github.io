<p style="text-align:left;">Forests Ontario has a <a href="https://forestsontario.ca/en/program/heritage-tree"> 
heritage tree program</a> for old and significant trees. It is a great way to enjoy nature and to
explore Ontario. Below is a map with the trees we've found so far, along with pictures. The lovely lady
posing in the pictures is my wife, <a href="https://dolcemusictherapy.ca/">Danielle</a>. </p>
